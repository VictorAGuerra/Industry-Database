# Description
This is the repository for the webapp used to interact with the database, inspired in a real printing industry, "Brascolor".

# Useful info
The SQL script related to the database structure and its population are also contained in this repository.

The framework used for the interface was streamlit for python web development.

Before using the interface, the host that created the database structure must be connected in the code with the SQL connector.

# Disclaimer
I am not fully responsible for this project as I was not the only developer.
I was mainly responsible for the SQL structure and population, as well as the queries utilized in the python back-end.
The project was passed as a group project in the 4th semester of college at C.E.S.A.R. School.
